# Cataract-detection
We have used CNN to predict the cataract disease. 
Our dataset includes four different sets of eye images. 
They are: (i) Normal, (ii) Cataract, (iii) Glaucoma and (iv) Retina disease. 
The eye images of healthy or not diseased people are resided in normal set and the eye images of people suffering from Cataract, Glaucoma and Retina disease are resided in their respective datasets. 
The data set is from Kaggle and the method we used is CNN which consist of convolutional layers with the Relu activation function.
Besides, the libraries like NumPy and Keras are used. NumPy is used for pre-processing the data and Keras is used in the process of testing. 
Our methodology involves following steps:
Step 1: Pre-processing data of images.
Step 2: Reading data using NumPy.
Step 3: Apply CNN model for training data. Step 4: Testing dataset with Keras.
Step 5: Obtain result.
